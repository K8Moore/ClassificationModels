# ExperimentalCode
Just some python code I've developed to explore basic concepts in machine learning and natural language processing.

This code was developed for a course in Machine Learning that I TA'ed during the Fall and Spring of 2019. It is designed to build a classification model using text data. You can use the following data-sets in my data folder: text_train_data.csv and text_test_data.csv. The data consists of Women’s fashion online shop reviews, consisting of a review text, and whether the review author would recommend the product. The code is designed to determine whether a reviewer will recommend a product or not based on each review. In application this classifier might allow us to find out what is good or bad about certain products or to feature more typical reviews (like a very critical and a very positive one). The code uses cross-validation to evaluate the results. It also uses a metric that’s appropriate for imbalanced classification (AUC). The code also inspect all models by visualizing the coefficients.
